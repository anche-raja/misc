Detailed Architecture Components
ECS Deployment:

ECS clusters deployed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) in both East (active) and West (passive) regions.
ECS EC2 instances running your Spring web application.
RDS Oracle Deployment:

Multi-AZ deployment for RDS in both regions.
Active-passive setup with active in the East and passive (read replica) in the West.
Route 53:

Private hosted zone associated with VPCs in both East and West regions.
A records (alias) pointing to ALBs in both regions.
Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Multi-AZ and Multi-Region ECS Deployment
a. ECS Cluster Setup:

Multi-AZ ECS Clusters: Ensure your ECS clusters span multiple AZs within each region to handle AZ failures.
Multi-Region ECS Clusters: Duplicate ECS infrastructure in the passive (West) region.
b. Task Placement:

Use task placement strategies to distribute tasks across AZs within each region.
2. Multi-AZ and Multi-Region RDS Oracle Deployment
a. Multi-AZ RDS:

Configure RDS for Multi-AZ deployment in both regions for automatic failover within the region.
b. Multi-Region RDS:

Set up the primary RDS instance in the East (active) region and a read replica in the West (passive) region.
Use AWS DMS or native RDS replication to keep the passive region up to date.
3. Route 53 Configuration
a. Private Hosted Zone:

Create a Route 53 private hosted zone and associate it with the VPCs in both regions.
b. DNS Failover:

Use Route 53 health checks and failover routing policies to automatically switch traffic to the passive region in case of failure.
c. Alias Records:

Create A alias records pointing to the ALBs in both regions.
Use Cases and Strategies
Use Case 1: Zone Failure within Active Region (East)
Strategy:

ECS Service: ECS automatically distributes tasks across healthy AZs. Tasks are restarted in a healthy AZ if an AZ fails.
RDS: Multi-AZ deployment provides automatic failover to the standby instance in another AZ within the same region.
Implementation:

Ensure ECS task definitions and services are set up with task placement strategies to spread tasks across AZs.
Enable Multi-AZ for RDS Oracle in the East region.
Use Case 2: Region Failure (Disaster Recovery)
Strategy:

DNS Failover: Use Route 53 to route traffic to the passive region (West) if the active region (East) becomes unhealthy.
Data Synchronization: Use RDS cross-region read replicas to keep the passive region up to date. Promote the read replica in case of failover.
Implementation:

Configure Route 53 health checks and failover routing policies.
Set up cross-region read replicas for RDS Oracle. Use AWS Lambda or automation scripts to promote the read replica in the West region if the East region fails.
Use Case 3: Application Deployment and Updates
Strategy:

Blue-Green Deployment: Implement blue-green deployment for ECS services to minimize downtime during updates.
Database Schema Changes: Use versioned database migrations to ensure compatibility across both regions during deployments.
Implementation:

Use AWS CodeDeploy or ECS deployment strategies to implement blue-green deployments.
Use tools like Flyway or Liquibase for version-controlled database migrations.
