DynamoDB Global Table Setup
1. Overview
This document provides detailed information about the setup, configuration, and management of the DynamoDB Global Table for [Project Name].

Purpose
The DynamoDB Global Table is deployed to provide low-latency, high-availability, and globally distributed access to application data across multiple AWS regions.

Key Features
Multi-region replication for high availability and low-latency access.
Automatic failover in case of regional failures.
Eventual consistency across regions.
Cross-region backup and disaster recovery strategies.
2. Architecture
Regions Deployed
The DynamoDB Global Table is deployed in the following AWS regions:

Primary Region: [Region 1] (e.g., us-east-1)
Secondary Region(s): [Region 2] (e.g., us-west-2), [Region 3] (e.g., eu-west-1)
Global Table Overview
Region	Table Name	Read Capacity	Write Capacity	Stream Enabled	Replica Table
us-east-1	MyTable-East	On-demand	On-demand	Yes	Yes
us-west-2	MyTable-West	On-demand	On-demand	Yes	Yes
eu-west-1	MyTable-Europe	On-demand	On-demand	Yes	Yes
Data Consistency
DynamoDB Global Tables provide eventual consistency across regions, with data replication delays ranging from milliseconds to a few seconds, depending on network conditions.

3. Configuration Details
3.1. DynamoDB Global Table Configuration
Global Table Settings
Table Name: [Your Global Table Name]
Billing Mode: [Provisioned or On-Demand]
Replication Status: Active in all configured regions.
Stream View Type: [NEW_IMAGE | OLD_IMAGE | NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES]
Global Secondary Indexes (if any): [List the indexes used]
Replication Regions
The table is replicated across the following regions:

us-east-1 (Primary Region)
us-west-2 (Secondary Region)
eu-west-1 (Secondary Region)
3.2. Global Secondary Indexes (GSI)
The Global Table also includes the following Global Secondary Indexes (if applicable):

GSI Name	Partition Key	Sort Key	Index Status	Replication Regions
Index-1	UserId	OrderDate	Active	All Regions
Index-2	ProductId	-	Active	us-east-1, us-west-2
3.3. AutoScaling Policies
DynamoDB AutoScaling is enabled for the following resources:

Read Capacity: Automatically adjusts based on usage in all regions.
Write Capacity: Automatically adjusts based on usage in all regions.
Auto-scaling target metrics are set to maintain 70% utilization for both read and write capacity.

4. Monitoring and Alarms
CloudWatch Alarms
To monitor the health and performance of the DynamoDB Global Table, the following CloudWatch alarms are configured:

Alarm Name	Metric	Threshold	Region	Action
DynamoDB-Write-Throttle	WriteThrottleEvents	> 0	All Regions	Notify Team
DynamoDB-Read-Throttle	ReadThrottleEvents	> 0	All Regions	Notify Team
DynamoDB-Replication-Latency	ReplicationLatency	> 1000 ms	All Regions	Notify Team
CloudWatch Logs
Table Capacity Logs: Logs all table capacity changes (read/write).
Error Logs: Captures DynamoDB errors and replication failures.
5. Backup and Restore Strategy
Automated Backups
Backup Frequency: Daily automated backups of the global table are enabled across all regions.
Backup Retention: Backups are retained for 30 days.
Backup Service: Backups are managed using AWS Backup.
Restore Process
In case of data loss or disaster recovery, the following steps will be followed to restore the table:

Identify the most recent backup using AWS Backup.
Restore the table to the affected region.
Validate data consistency across all regions after restoration.
Re-enable any GSIs or stream settings if required.
6. Failover and Disaster Recovery
6.1. Failover Strategy
Failover between DynamoDB Global Table regions is handled automatically by DynamoDB in the event of a regional failure. Eventual consistency ensures that the most recent updates are replicated across all regions before failover occurs.

Primary Region: us-east-1
Failover Regions: Traffic will automatically route to us-west-2 if us-east-1 fails.
6.2. Manual Failover Process
In rare cases, a manual failover may be required. The following steps should be followed for manual failover:

Monitor the health of all regions using CloudWatch.
If the primary region fails, manually update the primary application to point to a healthy region (using Route 53 or direct API changes).
Ensure that all write requests are directed to the failover region.
Validate read consistency across regions after the failover is complete.
7. Security and Access Control
7.1. Encryption
Encryption at Rest: DynamoDB Global Tables are encrypted using AWS KMS.
KMS Key: arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
Encryption Across Regions: Data is encrypted both at rest and in transit during cross-region replication.
7.2. IAM Policies
Access to the DynamoDB Global Table is controlled using IAM policies. The following roles have access:

Role Name	Access Type	Description
DynamoDBAdminRole	Full Access	Full access to DynamoDB tables
DynamoDBReadWriteRole	Read/Write	Read and write access to specific tables
DynamoDBReadOnlyRole	Read Only	Read-only access for application components
8. Key Metrics
Metric	Description	Threshold/Value
WriteThrottleEvents	Number of write throttling events	0
ReadThrottleEvents	Number of read throttling events	0
ReplicationLatency	Time for cross-region replication	< 1000 ms
ConsumedReadCapacityUnits	Number of consumed read capacity units	Varies
ConsumedWriteCapacityUnits	Number of consumed write capacity units	Varies
9. Future Enhancements
Cross-Region Replication Improvements: Explore further optimizations to reduce replication latency.
Performance Tuning: Implement additional performance tuning for specific high-traffic regions.
Additional Security Features: Evaluate enabling AWS WAF or other security features to enhance data protection.
